# 🛠️ The Process
This game was inspired by classic maze challenges and the visual style of Demon Slayer. I wanted to create a simple but enjoyable interactive experience that showcases gameplay logic and responsive interface design.

This project was created to strengthen my front-end development skills and explore interactive game logic. Using HTML, I learned how to structure a game layout with clear separation between the play area, obstacles, and goal elements. Working with CSS strengthened my understanding of positioning, layering, and visual styling to create a readable and engaging maze layout. Through JavaScript, I learned how to handle user input, implement player movement and collision detection, manage game state updates, and define win and loss conditions to control gameplay flow in real-time. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with event handling, visual feedback, and designing intuitive gameplay mechanics within a web environment.
